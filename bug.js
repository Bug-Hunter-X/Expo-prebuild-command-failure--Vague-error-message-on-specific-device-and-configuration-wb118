While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message was vague and didn't pinpoint the exact issue.  I tried several solutions, such as cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies, but the problem persisted.  My project uses React Native and several native modules.  The error manifested only on a specific device and build configuration.
